# Clerk Authentication Setup Guide

This document outlines the changes made to implement Clerk authentication in the OHAT application.

## Implemented Components

1. **Sign Up Page** (`app/(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx`)
   - Custom sign-up form using Clerk's useSignUp hook
   - Email link verification flow
   - Proper error handling

2. **Sign In Page** (`app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`)
   - Custom login form using Clerk's useSignIn hook
   - Supports email/password authentication
   - Redirects to originally requested page after login

3. **Email Verification Page** (`app/(auth)/verify/page.tsx`)
   - Handles email link verification flow
   - User-friendly status messages for different verification states
   - Uses Clerk's handleEmailLinkVerification method

4. **Header Component** (`app/components/Header.tsx`)
   - Updated to use Clerk's useUser and useClerk hooks
   - Conditionally renders auth state (signed in vs. signed out)
   - Implements sign-out functionality

5. **Middleware** (`middleware.ts`)
   - Protects routes that require authentication
   - Configures public routes including the auth pages

## Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```
# Clerk Auth Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

## Clerk Dashboard Setup

1. Create a Clerk account at https://clerk.dev
2. Set up a new application
3. Configure authentication methods:
   - Enable email/password authentication
   - Configure email verification (recommended: email link)
   - Optional: Add social login providers

4. Enable email verification through email links:
   - In the Clerk Dashboard, go to "Email, Phone, Username" settings
   - Under "Authentication strategies", enable "Email verification link"
   - Under "Email address" settings, make sure "Email verification link" is selected

5. Copy your API keys from the Clerk Dashboard to your `.env.local` file:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
   - CLERK_SECRET_KEY

## Next Steps

1. If you want to use social login providers (Google, GitHub, etc.), configure them in the Clerk Dashboard
2. Customize the UI of authentication pages to match your application design
3. Implement additional Clerk features like organizations/teams if needed
4. Add profile management functionality

## Testing

1. Test the sign-up flow with email verification
2. Test the login flow
3. Test protected routes to ensure authentication is working
4. Test sign-out functionality
